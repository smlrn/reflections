When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Working with others to share progress.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Avoid unnecessary or unwanted changes.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

A clone is a copy of a repository.  A fork is the name given to a clone on github.  A branch is when you have a separate path of code in the same project.  You would fork or clone when you want to try someone else's code.  A branch is when you want to add something new that you'd like to try but not necessarily directly tied to previous changes made in the code.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You will have the history of changes.
