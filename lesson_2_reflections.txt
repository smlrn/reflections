What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created.  This is how the metadeta structure and different commits are stored.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is temporary space used to update the repository.  The working directory contains all of the files and folders that are being worked on.
